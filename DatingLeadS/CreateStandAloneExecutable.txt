    Download the appropriate py2exe library for your system.
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/
    Create a new python script:

        from distutils.core import setup
        import py2exe
        setup(console=["filename.py"])

    Save this as <<<   setup.py   >>> in the same folder as the python file that needs to be converted.
    Open Start>Accessories>Command Prompt
    Know the path to your python installation. It is usually in the C: drive as a folder.
        Eg: The path to a python 2.7 installation would usually be c:/python27
    In the Command Prompt, enter the following line:
        PATH;"C:/python27";%PATH%
        (replace "C:/python27" with the python installation folder on your computer)
    Navigate to the folder in which the filename.py and the setup.py are stored using the following command:
        cd "path to your folder"
    Enter the following line in command prompt:

        python setup.py py2exe

    A subfolder called dist will be created.
    Inside the dist subfolder, copy-paste all the external media like pictures and audio files used by your program (if they were in subfolders, keep names etc the same).
    The exe file in your dist folder is now your program! (you need the while dist folder to run the program)
