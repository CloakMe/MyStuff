To create an electronic switch that can be controlled by a maximum of 3.3V and 40mA while ensuring that the output voltage is at least 4.4V with a load of approximately 200mA, consider the following options:
1. Logic Level MOSFET
Using a logic level MOSFET is one of the most efficient solutions. These MOSFETs are designed to fully turn on (saturate) at lower gate voltages, such as 3.3V.
Recommended Specs:

    Vgs(th): Should be low (ideally below 2.5V).
    Rds(on): Low resistance at Vgs = 3.3V to minimize power loss.
    Continuous Drain Current (Id): Should be greater than 200mA.

Example MOSFETs:

    IRLZ44N: Suitable for switching applications with a low gate voltage.
    BS170: A smaller option for lower current applications.

2. NPN Transistor with Resistor
You can use an NPN transistor as a switch. The transistor can be driven by the 3.3V control signal, and it will allow the higher voltage (5V) to pass through to the load.
Circuit Configuration:

    Connect the emitter of the NPN transistor to ground.
    Connect the collector to the load (which is connected to the 5V supply).
    Use a resistor between the base of the transistor and the 3.3V control signal to limit the base current.

Recommended Specs:

    Current Gain (hFE): Ensure it can handle the load current (200mA). Choose a transistor with a gain that allows the base current to be within the 40mA limit.

Example Transistors:

    2N3904: Commonly used for low to moderate power applications.
    BC547: Another suitable option for switching applications.

3. Relay Module
A relay can be used to switch the higher voltage circuit. However, ensure that the relay can be activated with a 3.3V signal.
Recommended Specs:

    Coil Voltage: Look for a relay with a 3.3V coil rating or use a transistor to drive a 5V relay.
    Contact Rating: Ensure the relay can handle at least 200mA at 5V.

Example Relay:

    SRD-05VDC: A commonly used relay that can be controlled with a transistor from a 3.3V signal.

4. Solid State Relay (SSR)
Solid State Relays can also be used as they can be controlled with low voltage signals and can handle higher currents.
Recommended Specs:

    Control Voltage: Make sure the SSR can be activated with 3.3V.
    Load Current: Should be rated for at least 200mA.

Example SSR:

    G3MB-202P: A small SSR that can be controlled with low voltage inputs.

Summary
For your application, a logic level MOSFET is often the best choice due to its efficiency and simplicity. If you prefer using a transistor, ensure it is rated properly for the load. Relays and SSRs are also viable options but may require additional components for proper operation
